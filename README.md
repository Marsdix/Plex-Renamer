## üì• Installation

You can use **Plex Renamer** in two ways: by downloading the `.exe` file (recommended for simplicity) or by running the Python script manually.

### Option 1: Using the `.exe` File (Recommended)
1. Download the latest `.exe` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/Marsdix/Plex-Renamer/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
2. Double-click the `.exe` file to launch Plex Renamer.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to organize your media.
4. The first time you run the `.exe`, it will create a desktop shortcut named **Plex Renamer**, which you can use to open the program directly in the future.

> **Note**: The `.exe` file is standalone and does not require Python to be installed on your system.

---

### Option 2: Using the Python Script (Manual Installation)

1. **Install Python**:
   - Download the latest version of Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
   - During installation:
     - **Check the box** for "Add Python to PATH".
     - Choose the option to install Python for all users (recommended).
   - Verify the installation by running this command in your terminal or command prompt:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```

2. **Download the files**:
   - Go to the [repository](https://github.com/Marsdix/Plex-Renamer).
   - Click the green **"Code"** button and select **"Download ZIP"**.
   - Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

3. **Run the setup script**:
   - Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files.
   - Double-click on `setup.py`.
   - This will create a desktop shortcut named **Plex Renamer**.

4. **Run the main Python script**:
   - After running `setup.py`, you can use the **Plex Renamer** shortcut on your desktop to start the program directly.
   - **Important**: Place the downloaded folder in a permanent location. The desktop shortcut will point to the current folder location. If you move the folder later, the shortcut will stop working, and you‚Äôll need to run `setup.py` again to generate a new shortcut.
